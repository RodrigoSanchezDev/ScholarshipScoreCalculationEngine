Proposed Problem: Scholarship Score Calculation Engine

Overview:
This project involves developing a PL/SQL solution to process and calculate scholarship scores for teacher applications. The objective is to create a robust, transparent, and automated scoring engine that evaluates applicants based on multiple business rules.

Business Rules:
1. Experience Score:
   - Calculate the score based on the number of years the applicant has been working in the public education sector.
   - When an applicant has multiple employment records, use the earliest contract date to determine total years of experience.
   - Retrieve the corresponding score from the "PTJE_ANNOS_EXPERIENCIA" table.

2. Country Score:
   - Determine the score based on the country of the institution offering the program to which the applicant is applying.
   - Retrieve the corresponding score from the "PTJE_PAIS_POSTULA" table.

3. Additional Score:
   - For applicants working in multiple establishments and accumulating over 30 hours per week, calculate an extra score.
   - Compute this extra score as a parameterized percentage (e.g., 35%) of the sum of the Experience Score and the Country Score.

Processing Requirements:
- All scores must be computed using SELECT statements and rounded appropriately.
- Before processing new data, truncate the following tables: DETALLE_PUNTAJE_POSTULACION, ERROR_PROCESO, and RESULTADO_POSTULACION.
- Implement comprehensive error handling: any error during score computation must be logged into the ERROR_PROCESO table with a clear message.

Implementation Details:
- Create a PL/SQL package that includes:
   - Public functions (constructors) for calculating the additional score.
   - A public variable to store the calculated additional score.
- Develop two standalone stored functions (outside the package) for computing the Experience Score and the Country Score, respectively, each incorporating error handling.
- Build a main stored procedure that:
   - Processes all scholarship applicants.
   - Accepts the extra score percentage as an input parameter.
   - Generates detailed score entries in the DETALLE_PUNTAJE_POSTULACION table.
- Implement a trigger that automatically populates the RESULTADO_POSTULACION table upon insertion into DETALLE_PUNTAJE_POSTULACION. The trigger must:
   - Compute the final score as the sum of the Experience Score, Country Score, and Additional Score.
   - Mark the applicant as "SELECCIONADO" if the final score is equal to or exceeds 2500, otherwise mark as "NO SELECCIONADO".

Technical Environment:
- The solution should be developed using Oracle SQL Developer.
- It is targeted for Oracle Database XE 21c or Oracle Cloud environments.

This document outlines the core problem and requirements that the PL/SQL solution must address, ensuring an efficient and transparent scoring system for teacher scholarship applications.
